# Ion Channel Fitter For OpenWorm

<img src="https://github.com/gsarma/ion_channel_fitting/blob/images/EGL-19.png?raw=tru" height="400">

This repository contains implementations of the techniques described in the paper by Gurkeiwicz and Korngreen ["A Numerical Approach to Ion Channel
Modelling Using Whole-Cell Voltage-Clamp
Recordings and a Genetic Algorithm"](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030169).

Currently, I only have an implementation in the Wolfram Language, but will have a Python port available soon.
